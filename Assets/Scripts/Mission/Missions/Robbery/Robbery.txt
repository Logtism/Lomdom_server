Player starts robbery -
Manager will find all robbery managers in scene, and pick one at random.
If chosen robbery is on cooldown, then the manager will loop through the remaining robberies until it finds one that is not on cooldown.
The manager will then wait for the player to travel to the location of the manager, and then will check for input specifically from 
the player that started the robbery in a trigger (the player will hold a key for x seconds). After this the player will have to travel
to another location, and upon entering the trigger at that location the robbery will finish.
